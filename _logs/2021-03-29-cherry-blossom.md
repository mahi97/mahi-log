Hi Mahi,

Campus became so beautiful, full of blossom that steal your gaze every time you walk out of your room.
I wish they could last more, but anyway if we could see them all year, they didn't became this special to us.

You had great sleep schedule and morning routine till you decide to attend a birthday party on 23:30. :/

Mahi that was not a good idea, it was fun, but it ruined your life, after three day you still can't wake up early.

You also applied for NAVER Internship program on robotic machine learning, I say you are crazy because there's no way they let you in.
But you probably thinking you are already too good for them. Anyway it's Korea and we don't have any estimate on how rough it the job market.

Nowadays, You are trying to manage your expenses, the main cost you are worrying about it food and how reduce the cost but still have good enough meal.
Thinking about what you have to eat is time consuming task for you, not deciding between best options only find a good enough option to eat.

At the beginning of this week you love your life and now you hate it, ha ha ha, Life happens :D

On the bright side you had much fun, but I think the problem is having fun while you are stressed about your work doesn't make you happy at all.

Be Happy My Friend. Please.
