This is 11th of month day of mutual respect in korea.

I had an excellent bubble milk tea, and I'm starting to write this blog.

Today morning, I exchanged money because I went out of money and had many things on my list.
Soon after went to ISSS to get the kitchen permission cost me 10,000 won.
Then I left for registering ARC. I'm getting good at using buses around campus, so I jumped on the 104 bus and, after 4stop, switched to 705 and arrived at the immigration office.


It was a cool place for an immigration office. Usually, in Iran, these kinds of places are full of soldiers.
The waiting list was too long since only one person for all ARC requests, but the procedure went by fast.


Soon after, I get a cab, come back to KAIST, rest a little bit, and go to the Lab.


Today is Monday, I was hoping to see many lab members, but I only see half of them. My computer system was not set up.
As soon as I arrived, they set up a PC for me and made my place ready. They did the best they could and really helpful, but in the end, it has only one monitor.


After my PC setup finished, they went back to work, and since I had nothing to do, I start wandering around the Lab and other places in N1. 
I saw Jy-young in his office. He was one of the lab members which now a post-doc student in Wisconsin. He will leave here in February. 

I knocked and walked into his office. He stands up and great me, then we talk about many stuff from AI, ML, and life. He spoke about himself and how he was doing the research in the Lab. He gives me one important piece of advice: You should be fast at implementing your idea because every idea will expire after 6 months, either because someone else done it before you or either this is a wrong idea if no one else has done it in that time.


I feel confident in my programming skills, but ML programming is different from what we usually do.


Back to the Lab, I sitting behind the PC reading some paper and getting more bored. Dong-Jun invites us for dinner, so we ordered Makarel and blackfish.
I can't believe it. I actually enjoyed a fish and a Korean dish.

The dinner was very nice; we talked about many lab members' stuff, and we feel closer. I ask about their hometown and the meaning of their Korean name, dumb questions maybe o_o

The Son-Young invite us for a coffee to twosome place on the 2nd floor of a building, she paid for all of us, and I'm really thankful to her.
She finishes her Ph.D. in six months and leaves the Lab for a job in the industry.


Now we arrive at this very moment which I'm drinking the bubble tea and writing on Github. At least it looks like a productive thing to do.

It's around 11PM, and most of the lab members are still in the Lab working ... how amazing. I hope I find a good interest in research, so it keeps me working like this...
