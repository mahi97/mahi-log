As a Persian guy, you probably don't feel anything special about the new year, at least I don't \_(0-0)_/

But today, I start to text and call some of my old friends to see how they do, schedule my daily life, and start reading papers.

The paper I'm reading today is about DNC, I can't explain it well in a few words, but it's one of the articles I wish I had read before. I'm trying to implement the DNC model and see how it works tomorrow.

I'm doing a daily log again. I'm happy about it :D
