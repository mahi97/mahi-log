It's **6 PM** arrived sleepy and hungry to Incheon, it was 10 hour flight. They check my health, installed some app on my phone check and re-check my quarantine place and put me in a cab to my place. everything happened so fast and smooth. I arrived met Jin the house owner we talked and talked about business and stuff till both getting tired and he went to his house and I went sleep.

*[2020-12-26]* It's first day in Korea, explore the room talking with family asking usual question, warm up some food I bring from Iran, eat, watch movie, sleep ....

*[2020-12-27]* It's second day in Korea now, again repeating the routing, but I cook some rice today which was easy, and played cyberpunk 2077 :D

*[2020-12-28]* It's third day, I should go outside and take a COVID test, hopefully it's close to my place to I can walk there, **9 am** I arrived there and there's a long line for the free test. after half on hour I get tested and coming back, they asked us not to go anywhere else and just back to our place, I really need eggs and bread so I bought them anyway. I'm getting bored in my room, cooking some noodle and egg, it's not that bad.

*[2020-12-29]* It's fourth day, really bored plan to cook a pancake today, but end up warming up food from Iran. For dinner I bought some Korean food, it's spicy as helllll....
I eat half of the food with coke and give up, cook some soup and good for today.
somehow start to doing some meaningful thing like writing this stuff on web. better than nothing. btw, today was started with reading a book on willpower good start than other days.
