Technically it's my second time at KAIST, but yes first time as a grad student.


How did it happen? Let's start in the morning.


I'm in Incheon, and today is my last day of self-isolation. Woke up around 9:30 (a little bit late).
Wear enough close to survive the cold outside, going out, and throw garbage out after 14 days.
Next, I went to several banks to exchange my money from USD to KRW, the price was around 1078.35 by the time I went in, and it drops to 1077.95 when I went out.
Back to the place, pack all stuff, check everything twice, and wear clothes as much as I can, Hasnain told me it's freezing in Daejeon, so I want to be prepared.


Ride with metro to Incheon bus station -> ride to Daejeon by bus -> get on another bus toward Galiki -> get on another bus to KAIST. Still, in the wrong direction, -> get off after two-stop -> wait about 30min, get on the right bus -> arrived at KAIST.


Yeah, here's the moment when I saw the KAIST for the second time, much colder than the first time when I was here in November.
Went directly to ISSS, see Hasnain by the door. I'm too lucky to meet him. I Received the ISSS registration package and a cool sweatshirt with goose pawn on it.
Next, we go to the Student life center, begging for a dorm, and yeah, after 30min, it's done, and now I have a place to stay at night. Hasnain show me the way to my dorm,
it's pretty close to his own.

I arrived at the dorm, the door is closed, and again waiting for a supervisor to arrive. A Really kind guy help me with everything, and I came to the room.
Nice room, larger than I imagined.


It's about 8 PM. I'm going to an international kitchen for dinner. There are many cooking tools you can utilize in the kitchen to make dinner.
There are a large number of Pakistanian who use the kitchen and share the meal. I joined them tonight, the food was Biryani, and it was extremely spicy.
I couldn't handle the spicy. Some guy offers me some milk. It helps a lot.


After dinner, we went to the Lab. Dung-Jun was there, still working around 19 PM. Other students left 1 hour before.
Excellent Lab, large desk, and pleasant place for sleep or have fun during the day.


Back to the dormitory, it's freezing right now. I arrived at the dorm and went straight to my room. Talking with my family, surfing the web, and finally, here I am writing this stuff.
