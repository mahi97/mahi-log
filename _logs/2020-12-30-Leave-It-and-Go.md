One thing that I can't get used to is delivery service in Korea :D
Usually, in Iran, you have to confirm once or twice that you received the package. The postman(delivery guy) gives you the box.
Here they just leave it on the door and go o__o. To be honest, sometimes they are more kind and ring the bell before leaving.

So as you expected, the usual routine for me is to check behind the door several times during the day :)

I know it's just because I'm not using the app, and there will be a notification in the application. But dude, at least confirm you're on the right house.


Today I cooked pancake and omelet, and it was good, It didn't come out a good as I expected but still delicious.
