One thing that I can't get used to is delivery service in Korea :D
Usually in Iran you have to confirm once or twice that you received the package and then the postman(delivery guy) give you the package.
Here they just leave it on the door and go o__o, to be honest, sometime they are that kind to ring the bell before leaving.

So as you expected the usual routine for me is to check behind the door several time during the day :)

I know it's just because I'm not using the app and there will be a notification in application too. but dude at least confirm you're on the right house.


Today I cooked pancake and omelet and it was good, didn't come out a good as I expected but still delicious.
