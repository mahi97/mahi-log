I just finished my last course of phd, still 3 and half more years to go, but at least I will hopefully focus only on research.

This semester I had four courses, all great and intersting but I could not spend enough time for any of them :(
Maybe it was a better idea if I took less courses this semester, but in that case I got to take offline courses next semester and that was not fun at all.

I had my birthday in last week, many kind people send me thank you message and gifts and two suprise gathering with cake.

Another highlight of past week was Younghyun and Jiyeon invited me to thier house and we cooked "egg in hell" :)
I spend a really amazing night with them, they are so kind and helpful to me all the time, I always hope I can be a good friend for them too.

I have less than a month for submit a paper for IJCAI and kinda stressed about my work, still the experiment results are not promising and I could not even finished the code, I really had high hopes for this one, I thought maybe this is my first big shot.

از طرفی هم خیلی دلم میخواد برگردم ایران اگه بشه طرفای بهمن ماه، اما یکی از شرایطش احتمالا اینکه بتونم مقاله خوبی سابمیت کنم تا خودم حداقل راضی باشم از این یه سالی که اینجا گذروندم. باورم نمیشه هنوز که یکسال گذشت خیلی زودتر از اونکه بفهمم چی شد.

اخیرا بیشتر از هرچیزی به بی هدف بودن زندگی و معنا پشت این بازی فکر میکنم اما تهش هم فکر به جایی نمیرسه، کاش یروزی یه جایی یکی اینو بفهمه

فعلا شبت بخیر ماحی
تا بعد :)
