Many things happening everyday, lots of changes, lots of new people I met that I can't remember the names.

Yesterday I slept very sad and Today I woke up happy, I guess sometimes time fix many problems, 
for a last few days I met several other Iranians working here:

Araz, Danial and Rasul from Mechanical Eng.
Majid from Culture Technology and Maryam from Bio and Brain.

Also many kind people from Pakistan, Indonesia, Maleysia, Ethopia, China, India.
Had great time with all of them, but...

There is one bad vibe that all of them send to me, living in korea is very hard, 
all of them feel many descrimination and racisim here, I didn't feel any actually or I didn't notice till now.

After they mentioned this issue I was look again in every conversation and every moment of interaction with korean, I can find some signs there.
It made me feel depressed, I had no hope for my future here...

Then I come back to lab and had dinner with people here, we had good dinner we laughed together, talked many nonesense and I forgot what I heard.

I belive this is just a matter of perspective, it's true that I'm not a korean, I don't want to be threated as a Korean here, and I should not force myself to looklike one.
I'm me and that's enough.

I wish I had more time for talking with my family and friends. 
I wish I had more focus on my work.


I feel it going somewhere good, at leat if I can get my ARC in time, I will get a good payment a bank account, new mobile phone and simcard.
It make everything much much easier, at least I hope :D
