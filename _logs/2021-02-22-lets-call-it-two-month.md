Sometimes I feel I should stop writing in this logs frequently, it drop the quality of my content. But to be honest these are mearly a content that anyone wish to read.
At least for now, I didn't even made it public and I don't know I would ever make them public or not.

I don't even read them myself so I don't know what's the use, maybe it's for myself in future. So I just want to say hello to you Mahi in Future someday unknown.
If you're reading this, you are insane.

If you are wondering how did you felt around two month after you go away of your home, you come to a good place. It's me the Mahi that is two month away from home.

These days you are dealing with finding your research interest, it's almost set the problem on scaling multi-agent systems, but you're not sure about which approach you want to take for solution.

I think you're happy nowadays, you have enough money that do whatever you want, you spend enough time with Rahil, your family, your friends, and even lab members and other student in KAIST.
You are not lonley and everyone accepted you, so cheer-up it's far better than what you've been when you just arrived here.

Big news for these days are Jy-young finally left the KAIST and soon he will leave the Korea, you met him for a very short time but I think him affect longer than that, I don't know you can tell this better that me.

This is a media which you can talk with your past, but I hope I have a media to talk with my future self :))

I start to like this way of writing, writing for no-one, writing for myself. 
Maybe I start to make it public if I could write more like this, and then Mahi, you tell me, was it a good idea or not.


Did you miss your home?, I face this question very often, I don't know what should I say. It's not a fair question at all, I feel you should never ask anyone this question.
Whenever I hear this question, I feel sad and guilty, I feel sad since I miss my family right after hearing this question, and I feel guilty since I feel my family might missing me too and they are just doing it for my selfishness.

I even hate myself when I write about this things here... 
But during tha day, when I'm in dorm, lab, having meal, ... honestly I don't feel anything, to busy to do my things, but as soon as I start to have fun, relax, go somewhere alone biking, then it hits me again.


Anyway let's skip this part like all hard part of papers which you skip reading, now skip writing...

Mahi, Last night was the first night you spend in Moonlab alone, doing works. The work was not that hard, it was just making a presentation for your professor. 
You also watched running man when you ger bored, your lab has amazing view at nights, you never notice it before like this. 
You can see mountaines from the big windows, same as you did at home but better :D

Today, you really missed you mother foods, especially Gheymes, I hope you can find it another day. 

The weather are getting hotter everyday and it feels like a new begining for everyone, maybe you should join it too and find you new self.

See you soon

Mahi
