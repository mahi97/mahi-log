It's **4AM** arrived safe and sound to Istanbul my flight to Korea is **2AM** next day.

Having enough time to recharge my battery and enough Turkish money to buy a sim-card and I'm good to go. The new airport doesn't have access to metro, they say a mistake happens in calculation and the subway station is happens to be few kilometer away from airport!. Anyway I got a bus to go inside city, I drop off on last stop so I don't worry about missing the station ignore driver and announcer voice just looking outside window and listening to music ... last stop Taksim Squere ... I arrived.

The bus stop is actually a little far from the Taksim, It's 7 in the morning to I walk to there. Really starving looking for anything eatable to buy few Turkish Lire in my pocket and looking for an exchange store with fair price.

Arrived at Taksim, taking rest eating cake and juice and wondering around, ask my friend Fatma, who lives at Istanbul to see weather shes awake or not, no response.
Most of stores are closes not many people but many animals, dogs, cats sleeping anywhere birds flying over your head and nothing ...

It's almost **9 am** Walking around till find an open shop, there's nothing, finding some beautiful church and it reminds me it's Christmas tomorrow.
It's **10 am** shops starting to open and accepting customers, but only takeaway foods. But some random stuff from the first cafe I see and head to the Galata Bridge.

It's almost **11 am** I'm on Galata bridge, it's an stunning view of the river and many fisher-mans two side of bridge sitting relax and focused small movement of the fish rod, beside them a bucket full of water which many fish are stored there, I wonder how many fish this river gives them everyday, more than hundred fisher man with buckets full of fish and it's just the beginning of the day... some say fishing in Galata is like gambling the more you get to more you want, some of this people came here in the chilling morning and leave on evening, sitting there waiting and waiting for the Galata bless.

I'm on the other side of Galata, heading to the nearest market and gaze to colorful foods and cloth, it reminds me of one of my shoes in Tehran and I need a new one, jump on a bus going to the mall and buy the first pair of shoes that catch my eyes.

Fatma call me, she comming to see me in Yanikapour Station, It's close to the mall I get on subway and met her there, we then go to Sanaii and then another station till we rechead to her house.

Nice house, nice designs, many snacks. :D
We talked about everything in Iran, Turkey, world, work, school, ... She was so nice to me and willing to help me in anyway she can, we order food. La-Majoon a bread cut in half and delicious staff between it.

We watched some documentary on Netflix, great background noise to fill any silence and give a amazing topic to talk whenever you run out of idea.

It's almost night and time to go, we had the dinner from burgur king and hit the road, I arrived to Istanbul airport with bag full of snacks from Fatma's house, waiting for the last plane to send me to Korea
