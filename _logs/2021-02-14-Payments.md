I felt I become a machine that comes to the lab and goes to the dorm with no purpose, mostly acting reactive and no individuality. It's not what I signed up for. 

So I decided to relax a bit and find myself I went on Jeju Island vacation.

It was a relaxing place, and for the first time in my life, I stop counting how I spend my time and money.
I just enjoyed the moment and leave all the worries for today, even though it was troublesome to find out how I spend that much money in no time, but still,
I'm happy to have a good time after a while.

I think I couldn't pass that level to find what I want, and I'm coming to this understanding that it's not a matter of what you want anymore. 
It's just a matter of what needed to be done. 

I will be the happiest person on earth if I make a good impact on other people. 
However, I can't find anything that is impactful, feasible, and still scientifically valuable. (or my department, idk ...)


The other day when I was in Daejeon, I went to the Expo Park. 
It was filled with families and children playing around on bicycles or scooters.
It suddenly reminds me of Rahil and Amirhossein. 
I really missed them for the whole day, my only wish is to bring them here and play with them. 
I would buy anything and do anything for them. I just need the opportunity to get them here.

More about Jeju, It was a great and relaxing place for vacation. 
We went there by SeokChan and DongJun, who had a car, and went back home on the same day.

We reached the Chungju airport. Seokchan and Dongjun left us since their flight was about to take off.

After that, we had a small brunch at the airport, and we flew to Island.
We went to Dongmun Fish Market and then Dongmun Traditional Market for the first night. 
It doesn't have anything special for us, and we just bought some orange juice and head to our hotel. 
Our hotel was near the east edge of the Island. They say it's the best place to watch the sunrise, and we expect to see it at 7:23 in the morning.

Guess what, the weather was cloudy, and no one saw any sunrise, 
we had tough hiking to reach the top of the mountain on time, but in the end, 
we just saw some clouds and went back to the hotel.

We wrap up our stuff, check out, and went for Udo Island.
The port was near the hotel, so we just walk to the port and sail a ferry to the Island.
Getting around on Udo Island was easy because there was a nice track around the Island,
and we rent some electric bikes with made it more than easy.

After three hours, we went back to Jeju and had a launch in a convenience store. 
Then took a bus to the waterfall in Shinwipo. 
As soon as we arrived, they close the waterfall entrance, and instead, we head into the jungle behind the waterfall. 
In my opinion, the jungle was as good as the waterfall, and we saw better places during our wandering in the jungle.

Then we went to our hotel on foot.
On the way, we went into an Indian Restaurant for dinner. 
The food was good but more than expensive for a minimal amount of it. 
I left the restaurant almost hungry and no will to buy a new dinner since we spent too much money on the last one.

This was our last night on Jeju, so we wandered around the hotels and crowded street for two or three hours, 
which was really fun, and then came back to the hotel and fall asleep.


In the morning, we left the hotel to the airport and to Seoul (Gimpo).
Our primary goal in Seoul was to eat some good Halal food in Itaewon and then plan for next.

After dining, we went to Namsan Tower, then Coex, then Lotter Tower. 
Then we came back to Itaewon to have dinner again and then the Seoul Station to find a cheap train for Daejeon. 
Everything went smoothly, and around 1:00 (midnight), we were at Daejeon got a taxi to the dorm.

I was exhausted, and when I woke up today morning, I felt I had the longest sleep of my life, but actually, it was as much as yesterday.
