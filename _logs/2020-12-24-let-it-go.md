Today I’m saying good-bye to my city, my family, my friends, my room and myself. 

I feel It’s the last time for everything, the last time I woke up in my bed, the last time I eat my breakfast with family, the last time I hug my father. At least for now … I’m not afraid of it. It’s like getting off one car and getting on another one. I just gonna miss them all…
It’s getting snowy, so I should leave soon to the airport. I wish I had more time to spend with family.

Arrived at the airport, everything seems okay. I arrived early, so have enough time. It seems there’s been some conflict between passengers and security. it’s about carrying too many cigarettes, a typical souvenir from Iran, after all, it’s cheaper than anywhere else …


There are two problems; first, they don’t accept my VISA! Second, I have 30Kg overweight!!
It took them about an hour to re-check my passport and VISA to finally let me in, and I sent some heavy stuff back home. Now I have 20Kg overweight, which seems carry-able.


Getting on the plane, drinking water, say my prays and let it go…
