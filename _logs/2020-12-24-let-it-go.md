Today I'm saying good-bye to my city, my family, my friends, my room and myself.
I feel It's the last time for everything, last time I woke up in my bed, last time I eat breakfast with family, last time hug my father at least for now ...
I'm not afraid of it, It's like getting off one car and getting on another one, I just gonna miss them all...

It's getting snowy so I should leave soon to the airport, I wish I had more time to spend with family.

Arrived at the airport everything seems good, I arrived early so have enough time, it seems there's been some conflict between passengers and security, it's about carrying to many cigarette, typical souvenir from Iran, after all it's cheaper than anywhere else ...  


There's two problem, first they don't accept my VISA ! second, I have **30Kg** overweight!!

It took them about an hours to re-check my passport and VISA to finally letting me in, and I send some heavy stuff back to home. Now I have **20Kg** over weight which seems carry-able.

Getting on the plane, drinking water, say my prays and let it go...
