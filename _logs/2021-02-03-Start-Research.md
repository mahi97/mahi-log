I want to start my first research topic in here. For weeks I was wondering around to find a good topic.
I still couldn't find the perfect topic for me, It's complicated but if I want to blame others I can say it's mostly because I don't have right colleagues.
But I be honest to myself, it has two reason 1. I don't know myself. 2. I don't have a strong motivation or goal to fight for.

Anyway, I follow Jy-young advise and start a research even from a very random topic and just focus on getting it done, while study more on myself and my goals.
At least at the end of this cycle I have learned how to do a research and if I found what I want I can apply my experience on that topic too.

The topic in my mind is not very random or unrelated to my research interest at least I can find a relation, frankly speaking all the topics in ML have some relation with each other.

I start participating in Bayesian Learning reading group, It's just me, Younghyun and So Young. We are trying to read and discuss about one paper on every Mon/Wed/Fri day 10AM. It also give me a reason to wake up early in the morning. So far we read 3 and planed to go for the forth paper.

I wish I could continue my interest in RL or Game Theory (MARL) in another group like this. I think I have to sell RL here, either they afraid of the idea or really not interested.

I should talk also with my Professor, I think he can help me on that, but before that I need to find some good motivated idea, not just a raw interest. It's a hard job but anyway that's what the research really means, isn't it?

Eating two times a day doesn't feel very expensive to me, but I have to calculate my expenses in a more intelligence way to make sure how much I'm spending exactly for each month(week or day).

For now my records only contain the day that I spend the money but maybe the purchase was for longer amount of time, like paying the rent of dormitory.
I like put more effort on analysis of my life and how I spend the money maybe it's just a side effect of working in a BI project. :)
