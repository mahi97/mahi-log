It's almost a month since I've been here. Every day is a different experience, more than I can explain, write or describe with words.
I think it's the same for most people who take this journey. 
If I short it, I was trying to fit in society, not only KAIST but also Korea, so I need to explore as much as possible.


Things I've done in last week was somehow expensive but makes me feel more belong here.  I bought a second-hand Bike, Simcard, and mobile phone. I finally got my ARC and open a bank account. I registered as a researcher in KAIST, and now I can expect monthly payments.

The first day I got the bike, I ride it like crazy all around the river beside KAIST, went to Expo Park, crossed the bridges, and at the end, when I got back to the dorm, I just felt the pain in my feet.
The pain remained for the whole week.


I find a more stable routine to pray here in N1, and that makes me feel better.


I was really struggled to fit in with the lab members. The atmosphere was not as friendly as I use to have in Iran. No surprise. But still annoying.
I talk about it with many of my friends in Iran and other countries. The final solution was to talk it out with them, and if it didn't work out, drop it. Find friends as much as I can outside this lab/


Surprisingly!! It worked. I talked with Jy-young, the Pos-Doc Student who was supposed to be in the States, but lucky me, he's still around and can ask his advice from time to time.
He will leave here around a month later. I talk with him about many things, from how to do research, how to study, how to find friends, and how to fit in the Moonlab.

He told me he had the same experience in State, and he feels what I'm feeling. That's what I was waiting to hear. I thought no one can understand me here, and it feels so lonely.
This was enough for me to accept the situation and make me feel good to start working with a team. The team also responded very positively. I really like every person in this lab.
All of them do anything they can to help me, buy me some food or coffee from time to time, and ask my opinion about group launch or dinner. It feels so lovely that we sit on the floor beside each other and having a meal. I think I couldn't find this sprint anywhere else. 


Yesterday I talked with So Young and YoungHyun about my research interest, and also they told me more about themselves. We start reading the paper and having discussion every Mon/Wed/Fri day.


More telling about my current situation is that I went with Soyoung and Namjin to feed cats around campus, and tomorrow I go hiking with many international students.


I almost forgot to talk about Hasnain. He's really smart and helps me in every moment. I am fortunate to have him here. We went to Sky road and JungAng Market a few days ago, really memorable moments.
The Market and street feel like real Korea in the movies, and during the night, there were a lot of LED Lights around the river feels so good.


To be honest, I really miss my family here, not when I'm lonely, but when I have the best of times. I really wish I can bring them all here and share my joy with them.
