Hello MAHI :)


I just finished my last course of Ph.D., still three and a half more years to go, but at least I will hopefully focus only on research.

This semester I had four courses, all great and exciting, but I could not spend enough time on any of them :(
Maybe it was a better idea if I took fewer courses this semester, but in that case, I got to take offline courses next semester, and that was not fun at all.

Last week, I had my birthday; many kind people sent me to thank you messages and gifts and two surprise gatherings with cake.

Another highlight of the last week was Younghyun and Jiyeon invited me to their house, and we cooked "egg in hell" :)
I spend a fantastic night with them; they are so kind and helpful to me all the time. I always hope I can be a good friend to them too.

I have less than a month to submit a paper for IJCAI and am kind of stressed about my work. Still, the experiment results are not promising, and I could not even finish the code. I had high hopes for this one. I thought maybe this was my first big shot.



از طرفی هم خیلی دلم میخواد برگردم ایران اگه بشه طرفای بهمن ماه، اما یکی از شرایطش احتمالا اینکه بتونم مقاله خوبی سابمیت کنم تا خودم حداقل راضی باشم از این یه سالی که اینجا گذروندم. باورم نمیشه هنوز که یکسال گذشت خیلی زودتر از اونکه بفهمم چی شد.

اخیرا بیشتر از هرچیزی به بی هدف بودن زندگی و معنا پشت این بازی فکر میکنم اما تهش هم فکر به جایی نمیرسه، کاش یروزی یه جایی یکی اینو بفهمه

فعلا شبت بخیر ماحی
تا بعد :)
