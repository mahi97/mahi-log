I feel like this self-isolation is coming to an end. I try to clean the house and manage food for few next days.
The house is too messy. It's harder than I think.

Today I emailed Prof. Moon for the new year and giving a report on my current situation. He responded very supportively as always.


Next, Hasnain talks with me about Lab and Lab members and, most notably, about the dormitory. 
It also leads me to email ISSS and asks for a more precise procedure for assigning a dorm to me. I'm waiting for their response.

Many foods arrived from Korea health center, mostly not eatable by me :/
either because of meat or taste. But hands down, the ramyeon is the best I ever tasted. 
Many cooked rice packs and water lift the weight of cooking rice on me for a while.

Jin sends me a video for working out at home :))

At the end of them, I kill time by watching anime and waiting for parsian3g to launch the group call. It's nice we still talk from time to time, definitely the best part of this day.

Nothing else. Good Night ~
